<p>USA Education Budget Data
<a href="https://datahub.io/core/usa-education-budget-analysis#resource-usa-education-budget-analysis_zip" class="uri">https://datahub.io/core/usa-education-budget-analysis#resource-usa-education-budget-analysis_zip</a></p>
<p>This dataset describes the US education budget from 1976-2016 in comparison to the country’s GDP. Additionally, there is data showing budget allocation to different branches of the country such as government, small businesses, etc. The data set is pretty small but I think this is because the data the website used was already cleaned up and processed. Additionally, the data is cumulative so there is only about 40 rows and 4 columns in the first set and the second about 400 rows or so and 3 columns in the second.</p>
<p>The main questions I want to address ar:
Is there a correlation between education budget and education performance?
Who gets the most money and why?
How can we better allocate the country’s budget?
Do we need more funding for our education system?</p>

<p>This dataset describes the hate crimes that have taken place from 2019-2022 in New York. The data set includes date, bias motive,offense category, and offense description and has 1664 row entries. This data was gathered from data.cityofnewyork.us. The dataset can be downloaded in the form of a csv and can be loaded. Questions I hope to answer include:</p>
<p>Which race demographic is being most targeted in New York?
What is the severity of crimes reported? How does this play in under reporting of hate crimes?</p>
<p>We could potentially find other crime data and compare the significance of hate crimes in terms of all crimes being reported/taken care of by NYPD.</p>

<p>Below I imported the data (2019-20_pbp.csv) of the whole 19-20 NBA regular season and playoff. The well-rounded data included the Game type, date, time, winning team, quarter, shooter, blocker, The most impressive part about the data is that it recorded every play of every game in detail, which includes 540000 lines. The magic of this data set is that every single play of every game in a whole season is recorded, if we are working on this data we can build a (for example )complete model of what a qualified starting pg’s game would look like, and fit that model to other bench players or rookies to see what part of game can he improve. Cleaning the data will include grouping the necessary column we need.
The challenge will be how we gonna deal with this enormous data and how we gonna organize the data to produce the result we need.
The possible question would be the best defensive player under different scenarios for a specific team.
Also it could be the best fast break player of a specific team.
We can also build a model based on percentage to find out what is the best play style for a player
Comparing the same team from different season we can find out what is the best team building features are. For example, we can answer the question of what is the best way to build a team around westbrook ect.</p>
