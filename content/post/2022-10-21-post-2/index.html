<p>Weâ€™re going to use the NBA data mentioned in post 1. The dataset is rather large with over 500,000 rows of data. It tracked every single game in the 2019-2020 season and to start I think we would just analyze one or two games first. There are columns that can be removed to make the data smaller such as location, date, time, quarter, etc. There is also a lot of missing data but its fine because each row tracks a single play, which may or may not involve multiple players. The important columns track points - 2 point shots made, 3 point shots made. A basic exploratory analysis could try and correlate shot percentage to wins.</p>
