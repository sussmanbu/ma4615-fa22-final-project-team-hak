<h2># In blog post 6, we will discuss our initial ideas food the interactive</h2>
<p>For our first interactive, we were thinking of making a map of NBA teams across the US showing what metric of basketball most influenced their winning percentage. Additionally, for extra functionality, we were thinking about adding different components to the map and making it more interactive. Depending on time, we may or may not add a second interactive so the second one is TBD.</p>
