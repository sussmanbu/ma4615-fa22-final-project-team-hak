<h2># In blog post 6, we will discuss our initial ideas food the interactive</h2>
<p>For our first interactive, we were thinking of making a map of NBA teams across the US showing what metric of basketball most influenced their winning percentage. Additionally, for extra functionality, we were thinking about adding different components to the map and making it more interactive. Depending on time, we may or may not add a second interactive so the second one is TBD.</p>
<p>Our team is now switching from analyzing players performance play to play to analyzing these factors under Teams. The ultimate goal of our project is to analyze players’ performance under different shot selection and percentage(players’ ability), and finally predicting players’ performance. To achieve this ambitious goal, we first switch our object from players to Teams and use linear models to find the general relationships. This basic analysis can answer the questions like: How important is the shot percentage in a certain distance contributing to a team’s victory, the parameters include offensive efficiency, true shooting etc. The ultimate goal would include predicting players’ performance and this will need machine learning or modeling. I am currently expecting using K clustering or Elo rating. To determine the interactive based on the evaluation, we can represent for each team how much a player contributes to a certain important standard(Ortg, Drtg, SRS etc.)</p>
