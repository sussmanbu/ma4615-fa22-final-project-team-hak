<h1>Principles:</h1>
<p><strong>Beneficence</strong> is the commitment to maximize benefits and avoid causing harm to the extent possible, even if it is not a formal or legal requirement. Beneficence centers the importance of considering risks and benefits holistically. Even large benefits do not always outweigh risks, particularly when risks are great and the people who bear the risks may not directly benefit.</p>
<p><strong>Respect for persons</strong> is the responsibility to uphold people’s power to make decisions that are in their best interest and to protect people who do not have that power. People can make informed decisions when they have information, the capability to understand it, and the freedom to act on it. When age, disability, or other circumstances, such as language or literacy, limit any of those three elements, people deserve special consideration and protection.</p>
<p><strong>Justice</strong> is the commitment to the fair distribution of burdens and benefits among people. This principle underscores that communities and people who bear risks and burdens deserve to benefit. It also emphasizes the responsibility to ensure that undue burden is not put on people unlikely to benefit.</p>
<div id="our-data" class="section level2">
<h2>Our Data:</h2>
<p>The primary data set we are going to use was mentioned in post 2: we are using an NBA dataset that tracked every NBA game in the 2019-2020 season in a play by play basis. The Columns involve “Home team””Away team”, “Home Play”, “Away Play”, “shooter”, “Shot Distance”, “Quarter”, “Shot result”. The project aimed to predict Specific NBA player’s performance and NBA team’s performance.</p>
<p>In terms of beneficence, our project seeks to determine the qualities that help NBA teams win. These metrics are helpful for determining areas of growth for a team or for certain players. We want to use this to maximize benefit (winning percentage, shot percentage, defense, just to name a few) to see what metrics influence performance. This data will not cause any harm.</p>
<p>In terms of respect for a person, we use a dataset that is published by official authority, which means all data and numbers are approved by the NBA. Dataset will respect players with religious faith, personal situations. Any other information that involves a person that is outside of the NBA organization will be anonymoused. No information in the nba dataset is being analyzed without the permission of the person itself.</p>
<p>The analysis we will be doing can be negative or positive for any player depending on how they play. We will not use the data in a biased way such that we only take positive data for a certain player or negative for a player we do not like. The qualities that we find should be shared among all players and provided as league wide information.</p>
