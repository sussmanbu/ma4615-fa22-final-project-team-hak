<p>What is your tentative thesis? Note that a thesis is not a hypothesis or a question. It should in some ways answer a question. (Eg. rather than, “What are the patterns of housing prices in Boston?“, something like, “Housing prices in Boston are rising rapidly, especially near T stations and along the water.“) The rest of the project should work to support that thesis. That doesn’t mean there won’t be any caveats or uncertainty, but you should try to accurately provide details
that provide evidence for your thesis.</p>
<p>8:</p>
<p>The National Basketball Association (NBA) league is considered one of the most popular sports in the US and the rest of the world. The business surrounding NBA is worth billions of dollars, and a significant amount of money is channeled toward scouting and paying elite players. All sports organizations usually incur a hefty amount of finances to acquire a player who may end up underperforming. Hence, there is an urgent need for a proactive approach to selecting players to avoid unnecessary financial loss. Luckily, the NBA is known for the vast amount of data harnessed for each player, team, season, and game. Therefore, we will leverage the available data and transform it into useful insights that will support critical decisions related to player signings and the allocation of salaries and incentives based on performance.</p>
<p>We are essentially trying to figure out how nba teams can use player data in order to better assist them in making drafting or trade decisions and salary negotiation so that they minimize money lost and maximize profit gain. Additionally, we will use these metrics to determine the probability of success of a player in the future. With the style of play within the NBA is shifting towards a more 3 point centered game, we found 3 point scoring and 3PT scoring ability to be the most critical factor to a player’s success.</p>
