<h1>Big Picture</h1>
<p>The National Basketball Association (NBA) league is considered one of the
most popular sports in the US and the rest of the world. The business surrounding
NBA is worth billions of dollars, and a significant amount of money is channeled
toward scouting and paying elite players. All sports organizations usually incur a
hefty amount of finances to acquire a player who may end up underperforming.
Hence, there is an urgent need for a proactive approach to selecting players to
avoid unnecessary financial loss. Luckily, the NBA is known for the vast amount
of data harnessed for each player, team, season, and game. Therefore, we will
leverage the available data and transform it into useful insights that will support
critical decisions related to player signings and the allocation of salaries and
incentives based on performance. While there are different metrics to gauge player
performance, our analysis focuses on scoring, in particular, the 3-point scoring,
because it’s the most critical factor from the primary players for any team as well
as the NBA’s favorable style (Nguyen et al., 2021).</p>

<h2>The Boston Celtics Revamp</h2>
<p>After losing to the Golden State Warriors in the NBA Finals. The manager of the Boston Celtics wants to create a new offense for the team. Inspired by the Warrior’s offense and their legacy as repeating NBA champions, the manager decides to look into 3 point shooting as a stat to base his offense around. Which players should he find and is 3 point shooting really that correlated to success?</p>

<h2>Rubric: On this page</h2>
<p>You will</p>
<ul>
<li>Title
<ul>
<li>Your big picture page should have a creative/click-baity title/headline that provides a hint about your thesis.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Clarity of Explanation
<ul>
<li>You should have a clear thesis/goal for this page. What are you trying to show? Make sure that you explain your analysis in detail but don’t go into top much mathematics or statistics. The audience for this page is the general public (to the extent possible).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Quality of Figures
<ul>
<li>Each figure should be very polished and also not too complicated. There should be a clear interpretation of the figure so the figure has a clear purpose. Even something like a histogram can be difficult to interpret for non-experts.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Creativity
<ul>
<li>Do your best to make things interesting. Think of a story. Think of how each part of your analysis supports the previous part or provides a different perspective.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: This page should have no code visible, i.e. use <code>echo=FALSE</code>.</p>

<h2>Rubric: Other components</h2>
<div id="interactive" class="section level3">
<h3>Interactive</h3>
<p>You will also be required to make an interactive dashboard like <a href="https://huyphan.shinyapps.io/example/">this one</a>.</p>
<p>Your Big Data page should include a link to an interactive dashboard. The dashboard should be created either using Shiny or FlexDashboard (or another tool with professor’s approval). This interactive component should in some way support your thesis from your big picture page. Good interactives often provide both high-level understanding of the data while allowing a user to investigate specific scenarios, observations, subgroups, etc.</p>
<ul>
<li>Quality and ease of use of the interactive components.
Is it clear what can be explored using your interactive components?
Does it enhance and reinforce your conclusions from the Big Picture?
Plotly with default hover text will get no credit. Be creative!</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="video-recording" class="section level3">
<h3>Video Recording</h3>
<p>Make a video recording (probably using Zoom) demonstrating your interactive components.
You should provide a quick explanation of your data and demonstrate some of the conclusions from your EDA.
This video should be no longer than 4 minutes.
Include a link to your video (and password if needed) in your README.md file on your Github repository. You are not required to provide a link on the website.
This can be presented by any subset of the team members.</p>
</div>
<div id="rest-of-the-site" class="section level3">
<h3>Rest of the Site</h3>
<p>Finally, here are important things to keep in mind for the rest of the site.</p>
<p>The main title of your page is informative.
Each post has an author/description/informative title.
All lab required posts are present.
Each page (including the home page) has a nice featured image associated with it.
Your about page is up to date and clean.
You have removed the generic posts from the initial site template.</p>
