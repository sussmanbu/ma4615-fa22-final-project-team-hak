The first data is collected on Kaggle. We first decided that we want our analysis based on the seasons 19-20 since it is easy for us to collect data sets with all the parameters we want. The dataset contains 231 rows and 34 columns. We use this first data set to determine the relationships between each parameter and our main protagonist of this project ‘3 pointers made’.  The data set did not contain as many rows as we wanted. However, in the columns, it covers height, weight, country, salary, shoe brand, draft number and all other parameters in other dataset. We are able to examine the relationship between these non-conventional parameters with ' 3 pointers made '.
 
Our second dataset for this project is collected from sports-statistics website (link #2). It contains recent data about NBA players’ performance, for the 2019-
2020 season. The dataset contains 651 rows and 31 total columns about NBA players, ranging from their personal attributes, such as name and age, play information (i.e, games played, minutes played, games started) to individual performance metrics, such as field goal attempts per game, turnover, and field goal percentage.
We introduce this second data set since we are not satisfied with the result we get from the first dataset. We identified that the reason for the model in dataset 1 is that there are not enough numbers of player’s stats being recorded. Although the columns are not as many as in dataset1, we still managed to perform some basic analysis between each parameter and most importantly, a better prediction model.

Cross-sectional data for this project is collected from sports-statistics
website (link #1). It contains recent data about NBA players’ performance, for the 2019-

2020 season. The dataset contains 651 rows and 31 total columns about NBA
players, ranging from their personal attributes, such as name and age, play information (i.e, games
played, minutes played, games started) to individual performance metrics, such as field goal attempts per
game, turnover, and field goal percentage.

We use the second data set for our EDA and to help us build graphs such as the correlation plot.

# Variables

# Most important variables:

## 1.3pm: Average number of three pointers made by a player per game. This is one of the most important parameters of this project as we are discovering relationships of 3pm between other parameters in model 1.
## 2. 3p: Total number of three pointers made by a player in a season. This is one of the most important parameters of this project as we are discovering relationships of 3p between other parameters in model 2.

# Other Variables:

## 1. Age: Average ages within a team on February 1st of the season
## 2. W: Number of wins
